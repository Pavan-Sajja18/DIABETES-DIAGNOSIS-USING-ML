The primary aim of this project is to create a system that can accurately predict the onset of 
diabetes in patients at an earlier stage by integrating multiple machine/deep learning 
techniques.One of the leading causes of the increase in diabetes 
cases is the sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits that many people now have. 
Detecting the disease early on is crucial in such circumstances. To this end, a machine learning 
approach is proposed in this study that utilizes several algorithms, including KNN, Decision 
Tree, SVC, Extra Trees Classifier, Ada-Boost Classifier, ANN, CNN, Random Forest, and 
Gradient Boosting Classifier, to identify diabetic patients. The system employs multiple models 
for classification and employs 10-fold cross-validation during training. The Voting Classifier is 
then used to combine the predictions from different models using voting, and the Stacking 
Classifier is used to merge the estimations from multiple base models. Comparison of two 
ensemble learning techniques is done, and it is concluded that the Stacking Classifier provides 
95% accuracy
