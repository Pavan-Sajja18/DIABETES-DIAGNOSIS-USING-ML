## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for diagnosing diabetes based on various health metrics and parameters. By leveraging a dataset containing information about patients' medical history, lifestyle factors, and diagnostic test results, the model predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in [data.csv](data.csv). It consists of several features including:
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Age
- Number of pregnancies (for female patients)
- Insulin level
- Skin thickness
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Outcome (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)

## Requirements
- Python (version X.X or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring the data and model)
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```
    pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3. Open and run the [diabetes_diagnosis.ipynb](diabetes_diagnosis.ipynb) notebook to explore the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Usage
1. Open the [diabetes_diagnosis.ipynb](diabetes_diagnosis.ipynb) notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
    - Load and explore the dataset.
    - Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scale features, etc.).
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - Train different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
    - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
    - Choose the best-performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters if necessary.
    - Save the final model for future predictions.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model can predict diabetes based on the input features.
